    Next.Js is servless which means it opens a new 
    db connection each time it needs to fetch 
    something from the db. Which further means that I had to 
    setup the connection to the db to be cached so that it wouldn't have to make
    a ton of calls to the db. You'll need to learn how to cache MySQL connections
    for serveless architecture.

    Will the connection to a MySQL database persist unlike the MongoDB connection?
